# Canopy IIIF

A purely IIIF sourced site generator using Next.js. Canopy is an experimental application that will standup a browseable and searchable digital collections style site entirely from a IIIF Collection and the items it contains.

> **Warning**
> Canopy is a work in progress and being built in public.

- [ ] Collection of Collections (i.e. `depth > 1`)
- [x] Harvesting of curated metadata labels
- [ ] Leveraging BCP 47 and internationalization

### Search
- [x] Basic search on label(s)

- [ ] Complex search on summary and metadata
- [ ] Search page facets on curated metadata
- [ ] `next/link` routing from Work metadata to search page facets

### User Interface & Experience
- [ ] Fully Responsive
- [x] Continuous scroll & lazy load of search results
- [ ] Custom theme support

### Configuration
