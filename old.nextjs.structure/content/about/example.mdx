# Markdown Example

Canopy IIIF is designed to work with Markdown using the [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) library. This allows you to use Canopy defined components in our Markdown content to easily extend IIIF resources.
This example page demonstrates some of components that are available for use reuse and remixing content in Markdown.

This page is output from the `/content/about/example.mdx` file.

<ButtonWrapper>
  <Button
    children="Read Markdown Guide"
    href="https://canopy-iiif.github.io/docs/create-markdown-content"
    target="_blank"
    buttonType="primary"
  />
</ButtonWrapper>

## Example Markdown

Using generated Latin, a sample blockquote and paragraph is included below.

> Aenean viverra quam sit amet sapien tempor, vel sagittis velit ultricies. In imperdiet posuere risus non sodales. Mauris posuere elit a lectus vehicula, nec ullamcorper metus aliquam. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Pellentesque et scelerisque tellus, nec vehicula nisi. Mauris auctor nisl non bibendum varius. Donec nec pretium leo. Sed ut sapien metus. Nullam elementum est leo, ac ornare ipsum accumsan id. Sed nec metus sed lacus fringilla feugiat. Nulla ut nunc sem. Ut efficitur tincidunt mi. Curabitur sed dapibus ex.

## Referencing Manifests

When authoring markdown content, users can reference IIIF Manifests in front matter. The referenced items can be output using the `<ReferencedItems />` component and will be rendered in a grid format. A link will automatically be created between the referenced item and the referencing content page.

<ReferencedItems />

## Inserting a IIIF Viewer

Users authoring content can bring a pan-zoom compatible IIIF Viewer into their content by using the `<Viewer />` component. The viewer will automatically be sized to the width of the content container.

<Viewer iiifContent="https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/cd5e1b9c-370b-40e5-b3d9-defc1d8e0777?as=iiif" />

## Inserting a IIIF Image (Single Image)

Users can also add a single IIIF Image to their content by using the `<Image />` component. The image can be rendered with a specified height. The label will be displayed below the image.

<Image
  height="400px"
  src="https://iiif.dc.library.northwestern.edu/iiif/2/edf54840-38c9-4a00-b180-0c038d77c6d2/full/1200,/0/default.jpg"
  label="List of Plates: Volume Eight: Edward S. Curtis's The North American Indian"
/>

## Inserting a Card

Users can also add a figure representing a Manifest to their content by using the `<Card />` component. The figure will include a rendered thumbnail for the Manifest, the label, and a link to the respective `/work` page. A Card does not create automatic linking from a `/work` page back to content pages.

<Card iiifContent="https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/19efac1e-5e79-471c-89c2-a60a775562ce?as=iiif" />

## Leveraging Facets

During the Canopy build process, new IIIF Collections are automatically generated from the source IIIF Collection. These new collections are faceted by the metadata fields that are defined in the Canopy configuration file. The faceted collections are available at the URL pattern `/api/facet/{label}/{value}.json`.

The `<Viewer />` component can be used to display a faceted IIIF Collection by passing the URL of the faceted collection to the `iiifContent` prop. In this example we are passing the relative URL of the faceted collection for the `date` field with the value `1910` for the path `/api/facet/date/1910.json` to the `iiifContent` prop.

### Viewer Component

<Viewer iiifContent="https://canopy-iiif.github.io/canopy-iiif/api/facet/date/1910.json" />

### Slider Component

These can alternatively be rendered in `<Slider />` component.

<Slider iiifContent="https://canopy-iiif.github.io/canopy-iiif/api/facet/date/1910.json" />

# Markdown Example

Canopy IIIF is designed to work with Markdown using the [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) library. This allows us to use React components in our Markdown content. This example page demonstrates the various components that are available for use in Markdown content, front matter, and compatible Canopy components that can augment and create links betwen your Markdown content and the IIIF Manifests contained in your source IIIF Collection. This page is output from the `/content/about/example.mdx` file.

Using generated Latin, a sample blockquote and paragraph is included below.

> Aenean viverra quam sit amet sapien tempor, vel sagittis velit ultricies. In imperdiet posuere risus non sodales. Mauris posuere elit a lectus vehicula, nec ullamcorper metus aliquam. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
