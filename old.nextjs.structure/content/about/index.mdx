# About

Using a single [IIIF Presentation Collection](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#overview-collection) as a data source, Canopy IIIF (Canopy) generates a browseable, searchable, customizable, and contextually-driven static site using Next.js without duplicating content.

## Use Cases

Canopy _“makes easy”_ the creation of digital exhibits for libraries, archives, and museums by providing user-experience focused components that bring IIIF resources to life. For digital humanists and scholars, Canopy provides a straightforward method to curate works from multiple sources and provide additional perspectives and aboutness beyond the included descriptive metadata. The decentralized, interoperable, and linked-data attributes of the IIIF APIs empower Canopy to provide smaller institutions with a streamlined front-end platform, neatly sidestepping the monolithic complexities often associated with conventional digital asset management systems.

## Features

- **easy [Markdown authoring](/about/example)** for scholarly content
- static page generation for each Manifest in a Collection
- customizable **full-text search** index using FlexSearch
- automatically generated facets based on Manifest metadata
- reusable components based on IIIF content
- interactive maps using the [navPlace Extension](https://iiif.io/api/extension/navplace/)

## Colophon

Canopy IIIF was originally developed by Mat Jordan and Mark Baggett at The University of Tennessee in support of the Rising From The Ashes Oral History Project. The project name "Canopy" is inspired by the presentation, [A Tree's Strength Is Its Trunk: IIIF as Central Operational Infrastructure](https://www.cni.org/topics/standards/a-trees-strength-is-its-trunk-iiif-as-central-operational-infrastructure), delivered by M.A. Matienzo (formerly Stanford University Libraries) and Esmé Cowles (Princeton University Library) at the CNI Fall 2020 Virtual Membership Meeting.

Canopy IIIF is created using [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/), with a [FlexSearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch) index for text search, [IIIF Presentation API 3.0](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/) delivering resource content, [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) and [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) used throughout for the user interface, and various community modules from [IIIF Commons](https://github.com/IIIF-Commons) and [Samvera](https://samvera.org/) supporting presentation and resource delivery.
