## Customizing Components

Canopy IIIF components can be found in the external dependency **@canopy-iiif/components**. Components can be customized as required for your project by following the [implementation guide documentation](#todo). We welcome all pull requests that build towards an extensible, clean, and IIIF-focused project.
