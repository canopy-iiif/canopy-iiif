# About

Using a single [IIIF Presentation Collection](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#overview-collection) as a data source, Canopy IIIF (Canopy) generates a browseable, searchable, customizable, and contextually-driven static site using Next.js without duplicating content.

## Use Cases

Canopy _“makes easy”_ the creation of digital exhibits for libraries, archives, and museums by providing user-experience focused components that bring IIIF resources to life. For digital humanists and scholars, Canopy provides a straightforward method to curate works from multiple sources and provide additional perspectives and aboutness beyond the included descriptive metadata. The decentralized, interoperable, and linked-data attributes of the IIIF APIs empower Canopy to provide smaller institutions with a streamlined front-end platform, neatly sidestepping the monolithic complexities often associated with conventional digital asset management systems.

## Features

- **easy [Markdown authoring](/about/example)** for scholarly content
- static page generation for each Manifest in a Collection
- customizable **full-text search** index using FlexSearch
- automatically generated facets based on Manifest metadata
- reusable components based on IIIF content
- interactive maps using the [navPlace Extension](https://iiif.io/api/extension/navplace/)

## Colophon

Mat Jordan, the primary author of Canopy IIIF, was born within the original homelands of the [Nimíipuu (Nez Percé)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Nez_Perce) and is rooted from Nez Perce County, Idaho, in the United States. Relating to this, the [source IIIF Collection](https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/search?query=%22Nez%20Perc%C3%A9%22&as=iiif&size=200) for this demonstration is a query for [_"Nez Percé"_](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/search?q=%22Nez+Perc%C3%A9%22), with results coming from the **Edward S. Curtis's The North American Indian** collection provided by Northwestern University Libraries.

The project name "Canopy" is inspired by the presentation, [A Tree's Strength Is Its Trunk: IIIF as Central Operational Infrastructure](https://www.cni.org/topics/standards/a-trees-strength-is-its-trunk-iiif-as-central-operational-infrastructure), delivered by M.A. Matienzo (formerly Stanford University Libraries) and Esmé Cowles (Princeton University Library) at the CNI Fall 2020 Virtual Membership Meeting.

Canopy IIIF is created using [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/), with a [FlexSearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch) index for text search, [IIIF Presentation API 3.0](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/) delivering resource content, [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) and [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) used throughout for the user interface, and various community modules from [IIIF Commons](https://github.com/IIIF-Commons) and [Samvera](https://samvera.org/) supporting the work presentation and resource delivery.

This demonstration instance of Canopy IIIF is hosted on Vercel with a consistent build time under 40 seconds. The build process includes metadata aggregation requests of 119 IIIF Manifests. This IIIF Collection and its Manifest resources are delivered via a search response from the [Northwestern University Libraries Digital Collections API](https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/docs/v2/index.html). Referenced IIIF Image resources are delivered via [Serverless IIIF](https://github.com/samvera/serverless-iiif).
