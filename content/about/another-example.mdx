# Another Markdown Example

In this particular example, we are creating mock content adding context to a work represented by a
specific Manifest. To do so we add the Manifest URI to the `referencedManifests` list in front matter,
and then use a combintation of `<Viewer/>` and `<ReferencedItems/>` components to output a deep-zoom
IIIF viewer and a link to the respective `/work` page.

## The IIIF Viewer

A IIIF viewer is a React component that takes a single property, `iiifContent`, which is the URI to the
IIIF manifest. The component will then fetch the Manifest and render a deep-zoom viewer. The viewer is
responsive and will resize to fit the container it is placed in.

<Viewer iiifContent="https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/84aec8c1-42e8-4e2c-a6b2-1c7e3790217f?as=iiif" />

## The Referenced Items

The `<ReferencedItems/>` automatically outputs a grid of items that are referenced by the current page.

<ReferencedItems />
